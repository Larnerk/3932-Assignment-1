            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Santos Saúl Álvarez Barragán <em>(born 18 July 1990)</em>, popularly known as Canelo Álvarez, is a
                Mexican professional boxer. He has won multiple world championships in four weight classes from light
                middleweight to light heavyweight, including unified titles in three of those weight classes and lineal
                titles in two. Álvarez is the first boxer in history to become undisputed champion at super
                middleweight, having held the WBA (Super), WBC and Ring magazine titles since 2020, the WBO title since
                May 2021, and the IBF title since November 2021.
                Álvarez is known as an excellent counterpuncher, being able to exploit openings in his opponents' guards
                while avoiding punches with head and body movement. He is also known as a formidable body puncher. As of
                November 2021, Álvarez is ranked as the world's best active boxer, pound for pound, by BoxRec; The Ring;
                the Boxing Writers Association of America; the TBRB and ESPN. He is also ranked as the world's best
                active super middleweight by BoxRec, The Ring, TBRB, and ESPN.</p>
